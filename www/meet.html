                <div class="content-body-desc">
                    After overcoming a congenital heart condition that gave her a short life expectancy, Julie dedicates her life to inspiring others 
                    to live with intention and passion. Julie holds Master's Degree with a focus on Exercise Physiology from The Ohio State University, 
                    certifications in yoga, group fitness and personal training from a variety of national accredited organizations, and is a Master 
                    Trainer and Instructor. Julie is a life coach, an international lecturer and author and has given over 2000 motivational, health and 
                    wellness lectures in the past 10 years. Julie is the proud mom of Cody, the Fitness dog, and Sancho, the Fitness cat. Both Cody and 
                    Sancho have used the 4 Paws Workout and lost weight, improved strength, gained energy and improved their quality of life!

                <div class="content-body-title">About Cody, the Fitness Dog - the star of the workout!</div>
                <div class="content-body-desc">
                    Cody, the Fitness Dog, is the inspiration behind the 4 Paws Workout. Cody is Julie's 'furry angel'. Cody is named after a boy who passed 
                    away of a terminal illness and helps to raise money to grant wishes for children with life-threatening illnesses by being the poster dog 
                    for many fundraising events.

                <div class="content-body-desc">
                    Cody is a long-haired dachschund, and staying true-to-her-breed - is a food lover! She will eat anything! Cody's vet recommended that Julie 
                    place Cody on a diet, in order to lose a few pounds and help to prevent future back injuries. Julie developed the 4 Paw Fitness workout so 
                    that she and Cody would spend quality time together, while exercising. Cody was able to reach her ideal weight and increased her energy, as
                    a result of the 4 Paws Workout. She now does it 3-4 times a week, to maintain her health and happiness. And, she thinks its a lot of fun!
